    <h2>Trigrammaton Qabalah (TQ)</h2>

    <h4>Trigrammaton Qabalah values (as in "The Angel & The Abyss" by J. Daniel Gunther):</h4>
    <p className="TQValues">
      A=5 B=20 C=2 D=23 E=13 F=12 G=11 H=3 I=0 J=7 K=17 L=1 M=21 N=24 <br />
      O=10 P=4 Q=16 R=14 S=15 T=9 U=25 V=22 W=8 X=6 Y=18 Z=19 &=26
    </p>

    <p>"On pages 364 – 365 in J. Daniel Gunther’s "The Angel & The Abyss", there is a table “Trigrams and some useful Attributions” where the trigrams are numbered from 0 to 26. In this table Gunther uses Base 3 notation to show the “Value” of the Trigrams.
In “The Law is for All” Crowley published his attributions of the English letters to 27 Trigrams, but he leaves the final Trigram – number 26 (remember this sequence begins at 0) with no English letter attribution. Gunther explained that this mystery plagued him for years until he came across an old alphabet training book where the Ampersand is used as the 27th letter. Apparently work has already begun to enumerate the text of Holy books to derive new equivalences."<br/><i>(Volume I, Number 2 of "T.H.O.T.H.: The House of the Holy" a <a href="http://www.twohorizons.space/" target="_blank">Two Horizons</a> Periodical)</i>

      One system of English Qabalah with a strong English gematria component was
      proposed by R. L. Gillis in 1996, and published on his website since 1998.
      Known as Trigrammaton Qabalah, or TQ, this system is based on one of the
      Holy Books of Thelema written by Aleister Crowley in 1907, called Liber
      Trigrammaton, sub figura XXVII -- Being the Book of the Mutations of the
      Tao with the Yin and the Yang. Liber Trigrammaton (aka Liber XXVII) was
      called by Crowley "the ultimate foundation of the highest theoretical
      qabalah". In Liber XXVII are 27 three-line diagrams known as 'trigrams',
      which are composed of a solid line representing the Yang, a broken line
      representing the Yin, and a point representing the Tao. Crowley later
      attributed the 26 letters of the English alphabet to these trigrams, in an
      attempt to fulfill an injunction found in his earlier work The Book of the
      Law, or Liber AL vel Legis.

    <blockquote>Thou shalt obtain the order & value of the English Alphabet; thou shalt find new symbols to attribute them unto. <strong>(AL 2,55)</strong></blockquote>
    
    <p>
      By attributing the English alphabet to the trigrams of his later work,
      Crowley considered this verse to be fulfilled, as noted in his "Old
      Comment" to The Book of the Law. The TQ is an extension of Crowley's work
      with Liber Trigrammaton. By considering the numerical value of the 27
      trigrams as expressions in Base 3, (or ternary), and then transferring
      those values to the letters attributed by Crowley to the trigrams, a
      system of English gematria is created. Further use is made of the trigrams
      to create a true qabalah in the sense of the definition provided by Jake
      Stratton-Kent above. In the TQ, correspondences are created with all the
      major forms of divination such as I Ching, tarot and runes, as well as
      Greek and Hebrew alphabets, the qabalistic Tree of Life, Western and Vedic
      astrology, magic squares, and the Platonic solids of geometry.
