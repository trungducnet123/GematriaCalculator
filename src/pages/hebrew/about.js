    <h4>Gematria</h4>
    <p>
      Gematria or gimatria (Hebrew: גימטריה‎, gēmaṭriyā) is a system of
      assigning numerical value to a word or phrase, in the belief that words or
      phrases with identical numerical values bear some relation to each other,
      or bear some relation to the number itself as it may apply to a person's
      age, the calendar year, or the like. The word "gematria" is generally held
      to derive from Greek geōmetriā, "geometry", which was used a translation
      of gēmaṭriyā, though some scholars believe it to derive from Greek
      grammateia, rather; it's possible that both words had an influence on the
      formation of the Hebrew word. It has been extant in English since the 17th
      century from translations of works by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola.
      <br />
      Although ostensibly derived from Greek, it is largely used in Jewish
      texts, notably in those associated with the Kabbalah. Some identify two
      forms of gematria: the "revealed" form, which is prevalent in many
      hermeneutic methods found throughout Rabbinic literature, and the
      "mystical" form, a largely Kabbalistic practice. Though gematria is most
      often used to calculate the values of individual words, psukim (Biblical
      verses), Talmudical aphorisms, sentences from the standard Jewish prayers,
      personal, angelic and Godly names, and other religiously significant
      material, Kabbalists use them often for arbitrary phrases and,
      occasionally, for various languages. A few intances of gematria in Arabic,
      Spanish and Greek, spelled with the Hebrew letters, are mentioned in the
      works of Rabbi Abraham Abulafia; some Hasidic Rabbis also used it, though
      rarely, for Yiddish. However, the primary language for gematria
      calculations has always been and remains Hebrew and, to a lesser degree,
      Aramaic.

    <h4>Hebrew Gematria</h4>
    <p>
      Finding numerical relationships between words and phrases Within the
      earliest Jewish traditions, groups of Jewish scholars counted the number
      of times each letter appeared in the Scriptures (as well as the number of
      words, verses, paragraphs, etc.). These textual specialists were called
      Soferim (counters). The Soferim ensured that every Torah scroll (and the
      other books of the Tanakh) were identical, noting any unusual words and
      spellings and replicating them exactly through their scribal arts. Many
      Jews believe that Ezra the Scribe instituted many of the practices of the
      Soferim. In the medieval mystical text called Sefer Yitzirah: The Book of
      Creation, the letters of the Alphabet are described as the stones used to
      build a house. They are called the “twenty two letters of foundation.”
      This doctrine highlights the belief in the essential relationship between
      letters, words and the creative process. Gematria is a type of
      numerological study that may be defined as one of more systems for
      calculating the numerical equivalence of letters, words, and phrases in a
      particular Hebrew text. These systems are used for the purpose of gaining
      insight into interrelating concepts and for finding correspondences
      between words and concepts. According to most practitioners, there are
      several methods used to calculate the numerical value for individual words
      and phrases. When converted to a number, words/phrases can then be
      compared to other words/phrases and similarities drawn.

      This dictionary was begun by Allan Bennet (Fra∴ Iehi Aour, now Bhikku
      Ananda Metteya) in the last decade of the nineteenth century since y-J.C.
      It was bequeathed to the present Editor, with many other magical MSS., on
      I.A.’s departure for Ceylon in 1899. Frater Perdurabo used it, and largely
      added to it, in the course of his Qabalistic workings. With George Cecil
      Jones (Fra∴ Volo Noscere) he further added to it by making it a complete
      cross-correspondence to the book DCCLXXVII. It was further revised and
      checked, re-copied by a Jewish scribe, and again checked through, in the
      year V of the present Era. The mathematical additions were continued by
      Fra∴ P. and Fra∴ Lampada Tradam; and the MS. finally copies on a specially
      constructed typewriter by Gerald Rae Fraser (Fra∴ y) who added yet further
      mathematical data. This copy has again been checked by Fra∴ P. and Soror∴
      N.N. and the proofs further by three separate scholars. The method of
      employing the dictionary has been fully indicated in The Temple of Solomon
      the King [Equinox V]. None of the editors claim to possess even the
      smallest degree of scholarship. The method of compilation has been to
      include all words given in Von Rosen- roth’s Qabalistic Dictionary, those
      specially commented on in S.D., I.R.Q., and I.Z.Q., those given in 777,
      and those found by Fratres I.A. and P. Some of them are found in texts of
      the Hebrew scriptures which appeared to those adepts to be of magical
      importance. Owing to their carelessness, the meaning of some few words has
      been lost, and cannot now be traced.
